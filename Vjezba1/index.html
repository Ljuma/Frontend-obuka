      I am twenty years old and my name is Luka Ljumović. I am student of
      University of Montenegro("Prirodno-matematički fakultet"). I am on
      freshman year. I am fast learner and I can easily adjust on any work
      module, that is exactly why my average grade is 9. 54. I did backend
      programming in PHP (Laravel). One of my biggest projects is an online
      library and blog site .

    <p>
      I won prizes in two national Mtel app contests (2021 & 2022) and one
      regional Mtel app contest (2022). One of my biggest awards are first
      places at international competition “Makinova 2022” and Competition of
      student companies from Montenegro. I competed in Gen-E 2022 – Europe's
      Largest Entrepreneurship Event as Obex company, and received a donation at
      the Start1UP competition. Also, I have successfully finished Optimus Smart
      Academy and Cortex Academy. I am smart, team worker, ambitious,
      resourceful, interested in programming, eager for new knowledge and ready
      to share it with others.
